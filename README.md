# Trip Planner

> Web App for Planning and Geographically Visualizing Trips

Built with Spring Boot and MongoDB on the Backend, Vite and React on the Frontend.

OAuth2 is used for signing users up and logging in, so as long as you have a Google account, you can use this app.

This application utilizes the Google Maps Javascript API as well as the Google Places API to mark and get information about places.

### Code

The `trip-planner-frontend` folder contains the React + Vite frontend application.

The `trip-planner-backend` folder contains the Backend application in Spring Boot and MongoDB.

In the future, I will be deploying this so it is publicly available.
